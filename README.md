# BogoTile
A tile editor for monochrome GameBoys.

Many such editors exist, but very few of them run on Linux, and even fewer of them run on ARM.  BogoTile's only dependencies are python and curses.

This is code written to scratch an itch.  (Put less glibly, it is a 100-line hackjob).  If you are looking for a beautiful or robust program, look elsewhere.  But if you are stuck on a strange platform and out of options, BogoTile is there for you. :)
